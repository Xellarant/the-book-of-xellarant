			<p>Monks who study the way of the equilibrium find their home in the chaos of battle, using light ranged weapons with a speed that turns them into a blur of pure speed and motion.</p>
            <p class="indent">They learn to link themselves with their weapons and weave their shots through the air as though they were extensions of their own body. Such mastery of shooting makes monks that follow down this path as deadly as any swordmaster in close combat.</p>

			<p><em>3rd-level Way of the Equilibrium feature</em></p>
			<p>At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with hand crossbows and sidearms, which are your Kata weapons, and count as monk weapons for you. When wielding these weapons, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<p class="indent">
                <ul>
                    <li>You do not need a free hand to reload a light weapon with the loading or reload property.</li>
                    <li>You can make an attack with these weapons as part of your martial arts or flurry of blows features. If you do, these attacks use your martial arts die instead of its normal weapon damage.</li>
                    <li>When you first make a successful attack roll with these weapons, the next 10 feet of your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="indent">You can spend a ki point to reload any weapon with the reload property as a bonus action.</p>

			<p><em>6th-level Way of the Equilibrium feature</em></p>
			<p>When you reach 6th level, your Kata weapons count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity. You can apply stunning strike to your Kata weapons, as long as the attack is made within their normal range. Your Kata weapons also count as improvised melee weapons for you, and you use your martial arts die + your Dexterity or Strength bonus on a hit with them.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use a bonus action to make your Kata weapons deadlier. On a hit, these attacks deal extra damage equal to your martial arts die. You only gain this benefit once per turn.</p>

			<p><em>11th-level Way of the Equilibrium feature</em></p>
			<p>At 11th level, you have perfected your form with your guns so that your flurry of shots makes you and your allies harder to hit. If you move 20 feet before you make a ranged weapon attack with your Kata weapons, the next attack made against you is done with disadvantage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, you can spend 3 ki points when a creature makes a ranged weapon attack against a creature that is friendly to you to use deflect missile as you shoot the projectile, throwing it off course or causing it to miss entirely. You must have the ammunition available to be able to use this move.</p>
