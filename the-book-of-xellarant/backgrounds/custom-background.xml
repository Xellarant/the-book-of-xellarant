			<p>Life, depending on your point of view, is a series of random events. Any number of things have led you to where you've gotten thusfar, and it's up to you to tell the story.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> You can select any two skills to be proficient with</li>
				<li><strong>Language/Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Any two of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Some sort of trinket, a set of clothes, the tool you choose for this background’s tool proficiency, and a pouch containing 15 gp</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>I could tell you, by your background, how you may think and behave today, but, truthfully, every human being is different and very little about people is ever truly that straightforward.</p>

			<p>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</p>
