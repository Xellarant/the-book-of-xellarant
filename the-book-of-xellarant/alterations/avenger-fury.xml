			<p>At 3rd level, your grudge enables you to channel divine energy for fueling magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your grudge explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
			<p>As a part of your Vengeful Grudge, you have the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Oath of Enmity.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to concentrate the bonds of fate between you and your current Wrathful Censure target. While this effect is active, both you and your Wrathful Censure target have disadvantage on attacks made against creatures other than you or the target. This effect lasts until the Wrathful Censure ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Oath of Pursuit.</i></b> As a reaction when your current Wrathful Censure target ends its turn further away from you than it was at the start of its turn, you can use your Channel Divinity to enhance the censure, making the duration 8 hours, changing the maximum distance to 100 miles, and allowing you to sense the target’s exact location from where you are currently located until the censure ends.</p>
