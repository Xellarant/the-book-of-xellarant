			<p>At 3rd level, your grudge enables you to channel divine energy for fueling magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your grudge explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
			<p>As a part of your Vengeful Grudge, you have the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Abjure The Unholy.</i></b> As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to renounce the very existence of a nearby fiend or undead. One fiend or undead you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your avenger spell save DC.</p>
			<p class="indent">On a failed saving throw, the target takes 3d8 radiant damage and loses its resistances (if any) until it succeeds on a Charisma saving throw, rolled at the end of each of the target’s turns.</p>
			<p class="indent">On a successful save, the target takes half damage and loses its resistances (if any) until the end of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Armor of Faith.</i></b>You can invoke a blessing of protection from your god when personal danger would threaten your mission.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a reaction when you would be hit by an attack, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a bonus to AC equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum +2) until the end of your next turn.</p>
