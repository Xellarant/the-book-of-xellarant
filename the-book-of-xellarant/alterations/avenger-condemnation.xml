			<p>At 3rd level, your grudge enables you to channel divine energy for fueling magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your grudge explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>
			<p>As a part of your Vengeful Grudge, you have the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><em>Abjure the Unnatural.</em></b> As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to renounce the very existence of a nearby aberration, construct, or undead. One aberration, construct, or undead you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against your avenger spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 3d8 radiant damage and loses its resistances (if any) until it succeeds on a Charisma saving throw, rolled at the end of each of the target’s turns. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and loses its resistances (if any) until the end of your next turn</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><em>Elemental Ward.</em></b> As a reaction when you or any friends within 10 feet takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to grant you and all friends within 10 feet resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage until the end of your next turn (the resistance is also applied to the damage that triggered the requirement for this feature).</p>
